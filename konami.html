<h1>BETO FOR TEXAS</h1>

<h3 class="konamiHiddenWarning">THIS IS WHAT YOUR LIFE WILL BE IF YOU DON'T VOTE IN THE 2018 TEXAS MIDTERMS YALL</h3>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="201" data-total-count="201">HOUSTON — It’s happening again. The stirring of the heart. The quickening of the pulse. The desire to abandon reality, even if you suspect there’s a world of hurt to come. Love, thy name is Beto.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="485" data-total-count="686">If you haven’t heard, our junior senator from Texas, a.k.a. Darth Vader, a.k.a. Voldemort, a.k.a. Ted Cruz, has a challenger for 2018, a 44-year-old Democratic congressman from El Paso by the name of Beto O’Rourke. Mr. O’Rourke may still be unknown to many, even in the state, but for those searching for a savior of the Turn Texas Blue variety, the crush is blossoming. Among statewide Democratic insiders, Beto is already a member of the First Name Club, with Madonna and Cher.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="544" data-total-count="1230">We’ve been here before, of course. Most cruelly in 2014, with State Senator Wendy Davis’s quixotic quest to defeat Greg Abbott. The livestreaming of her <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/politics/senate-democrats-in-texas-try-blocking-abortion-bill-with-filibuster.html">filibuster to kill a heinous anti-abortion bill</a> on the floor of the State Legislature turned Ms. Davis overnight into the Great Democratic Hope of Texas. She was smart (Harvard Law School). She was gorgeous (remember <a href="http://www.vogue.com/article/stand-and-deliver-texas-senator-wendy-davis">the fangirl spread in Vogue</a>?). And she had a respectable progressive record as both a city councilwoman and a state representative from Fort Worth. <em>Wendy was gonna do it!</em></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="264" data-total-count="1494">She didn’t. Our right-wing governor crushed her by about 20 points. Yes, there were some dumb campaign choices, and not even the truest believers could blame sexism entirely for the loss, but the bottom line was that the Republican Party was still running Texas.</p><div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">
<div class="story-body-supplemental">
    <div class="story-body story-body-2">
        <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="67" data-total-count="1810" id="story-continues-3">It hadn’t. Donald Trump trounced her by 52 percent to 43 percent.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="307" data-total-count="2117">Cockeyed optimists in the Democratic Party claimed that Mrs. Clinton lost by less than anticipated, but the basic math between the parties here remains unchanged, as does the conventional wisdom. The best advice for a Democrat running in Texas? Invite the press to watch you set your campaign funds on fire.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="387" data-total-count="2504">But then Mr. O’Rourke showed up. This time will be different, or so his proponents say. He is liberal and progressive, but also technologically and economically literate in a way that should appeal to business. He speaks fluent Spanish. He has served his district well, especially by touting the charms and economic opportunities (as opposed to the crime) on the El Paso-Juarez border.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="428" data-total-count="2932">Older Democrats like to compare him to the Kennedys, in his politics and looks. (He is handsome and toothy, with a thatch of shimmering brown hair.) Millennials like him because he once played in a punk band called Foss, because he started a software company, and because he has a few things in common with Bernie Sanders. Like him, Beto promises to go it alone, without support from consultants and political action committees.</p><div class="newsletter-signup variant-1-hidden " id="newsletter-promo" data-newsletter-productCode="TY" data-newsletter-productTitle="Opinion Today" aria-labeledby="newsletter-promo-heading">
        <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="274" data-total-count="4931" id="story-continues-4">Subsequently, Mr. Castro decided the time wasn’t right — see Texas Democrats, above — and never declared his candidacy. Unless someone else decides to run in the Republican or Democratic primaries, that leaves Mr. O’Rourke alone, slingshot in hand, against Mr. Cruz.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="67" data-total-count="4998">So that’s the good news, the stuff Democratic dreams are made of.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="450" data-total-count="5448">Here’s the bad news: Thus far, Mr. O’Rourke has a $400,000 war chest compared with Mr. Cruz’s $4.2 million, a big deficit to make up when the cost of running a statewide campaign in Texas starts at $1 million a week. There’s the power of incumbency, too. Mr. Cruz may be bruised, but he’s hardly bloodied. He even has 2.6 million Twitter followers to Mr. O’Rourke’s 25,000, proving once again that social media is not just for hipsters.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="390" data-total-count="5838">Some believe that a Democratic primary race, however divisive, would have prepped the victor to withstand Mr. Cruz’s ruthless campaign tactics. (Mr. O’Rourke had two arrests in the 1990s, one for D.U.I. and another for breaking and entering. Though both incidents have been explained away as youthful indiscretions, Mr. Cruz will be sure to turn them into high crimes and misdemeanors.)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="212" data-total-count="6050">Finally, there’s the biggest problem of all: Democrats haven’t won a statewide race in Texas since 1994. John Cornyn, the senior Texas senator, has described Mr. O’Rourke’s run as “a suicide mission.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="73" data-total-count="6123">Maybe. Probably. But this is Texas: If you can’t dream big, why bother?</p>
