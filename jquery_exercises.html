<h1>Beto For Texas</h1>
<div class="betoBackground">
    <p id="firstParagraph" class="codeup">"Beto O’Rourke is a fourth-generation Texan, born and raised in El Paso. After graduating from Columbia University, Beto worked in New York for a few years before deciding to move back to his hometown and start a small technology company. El Paso wasn’t the most likely place to start a company like this, but thanks to the work of some really talented El Pasoans, the company was a success. Over the years Stanton Street hired dozens of people in high skill, high-wage jobs that one might not expect to see in a border community."</p>
    <p id="secondParagraph">"In Congress, Beto serves on the House Committees for Armed Services and Veterans Affairs. He has made it a priority to work across the aisle to secure bipartisan support for his legislation, because Beto knows our country is at its best when we can put party aside to work together, build consensus and find common ground."</p>
    <p id="codeup">"Much of Beto’s focus has been on improving the ability for veterans to get the health care — and other earned benefits — that they need. He’s also been focused on curbing the influence of corporate money in Congress. He helped introduce the “No PAC Act,” which would stop candidates for federal office from relying on PACs to bankroll their campaigns."</p>

ID SELECTORS

    1) Create content in your HTML file using at least the following elements: h1, p, ul, li, div.
    2) Add several attributes to your elements; you will need both id and class attributes.
    3) Use jQuery to select an element by the id. Alert the contents of the element.
    4) Update the jQuery code to select and alert a different id.
    5) Use the same id on 2 elements. How does this change the jQuery selection?
    6) Remove the duplicate id. Each id should be unique on that page.

/*    
CLASS SELECTORS

    1) Remove your custom jQuery code from previous exercises.
    2) Update your code so that at least 3 different elements have the same class named codeup.
    3) Using jQuery, create a border around all elements with the class codeup that is 1 pixel wide and red.
    4) Remove the class from one of the elements. Refresh and test that the border has been removed.
    5) Give another element an id of codeup. Does this element get a border now?*/
